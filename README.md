# Interpretable Bias Detection
Project for *Trustworthy Machine Learning* course at Jagiellonian University.

Contains: 
[**B-cos**](https://github.com/B-cos/B-cos-v2) in [bcos_model directory](/bcos_model)
[**PipNet**](https://github.com/M-Nauta/PIPNet)) in [pipnet_model directory](/pipnet_model)

Intended to be uses with *gender biased CelebA* and *WaterBirds* datasets from [B2T](https://github.com/alinlab/b2t).

Dataset can be processed with **prepar_\*.py** script. 
Its placement should be added as arg for pipnet and in [bcos settings file](/bcos_model/bcos/settings.py).

[yml](/TML_environment.yml) file should be sued to create the environment. 

Training scripts for both datasets are in associated model subdirectoies.
